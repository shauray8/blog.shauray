        <h1>WHAT EXACTLY IS THE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM</h1>
      <p class ="intro">SHAURAY SINGH · SEPTEMBER 9, 2021</p>

      <p>

      With this little blog I would love to give you a notion of what real numbers are and trust
      me a lot of students don't really understand what real numbers are. <br><br>

      A lot of advanced concepts are based on concepts of numbers and this is what proffesors like 
      teaching before any advanced calculus class.<br><br>

      most of the blog is gonna follow the stucture from the book Principals of mathematical 
      analysis by walter rudin you ask why because that is the book I followed and I think that is
      one of the most well written books for analysis out there. <br><br>

      So we will try building up to real numbers one step at a time starting with Rational Numbers
      which has a bourbaki notation of Q (and for someone who is not familier with rational 
      numbers its numbers in the form of p/q where p,q &#8712; Z where Z denotes integers and 
      q &#8800; 0) <br><br>

      Now if we have Rational Numbers why do we even need Real Numbers and the answer is very 
      obvious Rational Numbers have holes in it (and by holes a mean litteral holes). <br><br>

      And you probably know a hole from your elementry school or your high school and that is 
      &#8730;2. How &#8730;2 is a hole you ask beacause you can never represent it with the basic
      notation of rationals that is p/q. You can try if you want and if you know a little bit of
      programming you try this actually but let me tell you something your program will never halt
      it means that we'll never know if &#8730;2 is rational or not and ofcourse thats not the case
      and mathematicians have already figured it out and you gonna see the it in a while.<br><br>

      By the way all the holes in the rational number system are called irrational numbers and 
      if you want a defination for irrational numbers it has to be "numbers with infinte decimal
      expansions which are often approximated" as &#8730;2 is often written as 1.414. <br><br>
  
    </p>
    <p class="proof">
      
      Here's the proof that &#8730;2 is irrational. (This is a proof by contradiction and if you
      have absolutly no knowledge of proofs you should first learn some basics of the same and 
      I do have a blog on it go take a look).<br><br>

      m = &#8730;2 <br>
      m&sup2; = 2 <br>
      p&sup2;/q&sup2; = 2 <br>
      p&sup2; = 2q&sup2; <br>
      this shows that p&sup2; is even and if p&sup2; is even then p is even (if p&sup2; were odd
      then p would be odd) <br>
      (2n)&sup2; = 2q&sup2; we can substitute p with 2n because its even <br>
      4n&sup2; = 2q&sup2; <br> this shows that n&sup2; is divisible by 4 and this shows that the 
      right side is also divisible by 4 and this proves that q&sup2; is even which implies q is 
      even <br><br>

      Our assumption that (1) holds this leads to the conclusion that both m ans n are even, 
      contrary to our choice of p and q. Hence (1) is impossible for rational m. &#8718;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now with this we proved that rational number system as certain gaps but this is not all 
      there is still something about the rational number system that is a little counter
      intuative at first and that is "there is always a rational number between any two rational
      numbers" and its statement would be<br>
      if r &#60; s then r &#60; (r+s)/2 &#60; s.<br>
      And if you don't beleve me here's the proof.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="proof">
      
    </p>

    <p>Now I'm gonna start using some basic set notations because its cool now if you are not
    famalier with any of it just google it or find a my blog on sets and you'll find explainations
    to all the notatins there.
    </p>
    <h3> ORDERED SETS.</h3>

    <p>
      Defination: Let S be a set. An order on S is a relation, denotd by &#60;, with the following
      properties.<Br><Br>
      1. if x &#8712; S and y &#8712; S then one and only one of the statements x &#60; y, x = y, 
      y &#60; x is true.<br>
      2. if x,y,z &#8712; S, if x &#60; y and y &#60; z, then x &#60; z. its called the 
      law of trichotomy<br><br>

      I feel like this is straight forward defination and it'll get clear with the examples ahead
      but to explain it in simple words an ordered set is a set S in which an order is defined.
      <Br><Br>

      Defination: S is an ordered set and E &#8834; S. if there exist a B &#8712; S such that 
      x &#8804; B for every x &#8712; E, we say that E is bounded above and B is called an upper
      bound of E.<br><br>
      this tells that for a set E &#8707; B &#8712; S such that B is greater than every element of
      E. ie. {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} this perticular set has 9 or 11 or 100 or 1000 as an upper bound.
      <br>
      and the same goes with the lower bound which is defined in the same way with &#8805;
      in place of &#8804;. ie. the set we defined above has 1 or 0 or any -ve number as its 
      lower bound.

      </center>

    </p>
    <p>
      Now with this concept we can further proof the existance of a Lowerst Upper Bound also called
      as supremum or sup and a Greatest Lower Bound also called as infimum or inf.

      S is the successor function S : N - N
