      a U b == U{a,b}

      set are the fundamental building blocks of mathematics.
      a set is a collection of objects
      ∈ this notation (describe) and the inverse of it and there exists
      venn diagram vdo
      use capital letters for set and lower case for elements
      {s∈S:sis a Greek letter}={α,β}
      how to read this
      It iscrucialthat you can translate between set notationsand English, or you will be incapable of understanding most higher-level mathematics
      N=Z+=natural numbers={1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}N0=W=Z+0=whole numbers={0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}Z=integers={. . . ,−3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}Q=rational numbers={mn:m∈Zandn∈N}={ab:a,b∈Zandb6=0}R=real numbersR\Q=irrational numbers(read ‘RminusQ’)C=complex numbers={x+iy:x,y∈R,  wherei=√−1}Z≥n=Integers≥n={n,n+1,n+2,n+3, . . .}nZ=multiples ofn={. . . ,−3n,−2n,−n, 0,n, 2n, 3n, . . .}
      A={x∈R:x2+3x+2=0}
      a simple calculation tells us that A = {-1,-2}
      intervals == (0, 1) ={x∈R: 0 less than x < 1} >
      [1,∞) ={x∈R:x≥1}  vdo
      finite sets and infinite sets
      lenth of a set also called cardinality
      ∅ empty set {n∈N:n<0>} this is an axiom that is a basic assumption in order to do math but cannot prove
      by this we can assume the existance of some set that has nothing in it 
      A=B⇐⇒A⊆BandB⊆A
      we have∅⊆A and A⊆A
      If A⊆B and B⊆C, then A⊆C
      A⊆B=⇒|A|≤|B|
      AC={x∈U:x/∈A} complement of set A, 
      B\A={x∈B:x/∈A} everything in B but not is A
      union, intersection and disjoint
      LetA= (−∞, 3)andB= [−2,∞)in interval notation. ThenA∪B=RandA∩B= [−2, 3) vdo solution

      now with this knowledge we can try proving some stuff (A∩B)C=AC∪BC.  2.(A∪B)C=AC∩BC.

      x∈(A∩B)C=⇒x/∈A∩B=⇒xnot a member ofboth AandB=⇒xnot inat least oneofAandB=⇒x/∈Aorx/∈B=⇒x∈ACorx∈BC=⇒x∈AC∪BC

      Functions -- domain and range and codomain
      f:A→B

      vdo of f:x→x^2 - [-3,2) -- [0, 9] 
      
      injections surjections bijections 
      injective = ∀a1,a2∈A,f(a1) =f(a2) =⇒a1=a2 this is 1 to 1 

      ∀b∈B,∃a∈Asuch thatf(a) =b onto or surjective takes every value in codomain

      invertable or bijective is both

      example - f:x=x^2 this is neither surjective nor injective

      Prove thatf:R\{1}→R\{2}defined byf(x) =2+11−xis bijective try to do this and explain 
      
      bijective functions have inverses!
      since f is surjective we know that B = range(f) and f is injective then a in A is unique 
      so inverse is the opp of the original function


      if a function is not surjective so we make it by restricting the range g:[0, 3]→[0, 9]:x7→x2

      vdo of f of g of x

      if f(x) =x2andg(x) =1/x−1 while doing this take care of the domain

      some more set and infinite sets also remaining


      return of set theory starts here --

      power set is the set of all the subsets of a set shown as P(a)

      the cardinality of a power set is defined by the pascals triangle
