      <h1>Why should I learn mathematical logic?</h1>

      <p>

      What is logic?<br>
      It is something that can take you from assumptions to conclusions. Okay, this is a fairly good definition but what exactly is mathematical logic all about maybe the definition is good by itself but I don't believe in definitions and prefer visualizing when possible so here it is "How mathematical logic can help you discover beautiful insights into nature".<br><br>

      logic is just making sense out of variables so to start with here is a classic example<br><br>

      <i>all men are mortal</i><br>
      <i>Socrates is a man.</i><br>
      <i>Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</i><br><br>

      here "all men are mortal" can be referred to as A, "Socrates is a man" can be referred to as B and the last sentence can be referred to as C<br>
      now we will play with some symbols mainly " ∧, →, ¬, ∨ " (at least for now)<br><br>

      every symbol has its truth table. Now, what exactly is a truth table?<br>
      Every variable can be in a state of either True or False and certain combinations of Trues and Falses can give different results depending on the operations(those symbols I talked about earlier)<br>br>

      the negation symbol (¬) also called as not takes in a single variable and makes it the opposite of itself. for example if A = True then ¬A = False.<br>
      the truth table for negation is fairly simple<br><br>

      <b>insert image of negation here</b><br><br>

      maybe we can now try solving some stuff with just negation<br>
      previously we make some variables A, B and C if you don't remember it just go and take a quick look at it<br>
      so coming to the questions what is ¬A?<br>
      A = "all men are mortal" then the negation of it has to be "all men are not mortal".<br>
      Okay, this was fairly simple now what is ¬(¬A) Now it has 2 negation symbols and if ¬A was "all men are not mortal" then the negation of it has to be "all men are mortal" right?<br><br>
